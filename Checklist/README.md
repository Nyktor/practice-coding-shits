# A FANTASTIC APP!!!

that i designed to practice and that does absolutely nothing besides being a to-do list with only 4 pitiful options:

## Add task
You know, write a fucking task and it adds it

## Check / Uncheck task
I didn't know how to strikethrough tasks so i just put them in a lighter gray

## Edit task
You select the task okay? You click on the yellow button, the pencil, the second square from the left and from the right. It allows you to edit. That's it.

## Delete task
It spawns an unicorn behind you that will make your testicle spheres fucking explode (?) jk just deletes the task

### Experts recommend it!
> Best app in all the gihtub, i'm sure you'll use it everyday all the day for everything all the thing

> **- Lady Gaga probably**

It saves everything in an unprotected vulnerable .txt file. fantastic!
